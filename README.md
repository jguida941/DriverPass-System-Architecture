# DriverPass System Architecture Documentation
*CS 255 - Systems Analysis & Design*

## Overview

Professional system specification for DriverPass, a cloud-native driver training platform designed to reduce DMV test failure rates through integrated online and on-road training.

## Documents

### 1. Business Requirements Document (`business_requirements.md`)
Complete technical specification including:
- System architecture with caching and dispatch layers
- Functional requirements with atomic operations
- Security design (JWT, TLS 1.3, tokenized payments)
- Performance targets (<100ms response, 10K concurrent users)
- Technical constraints and future extensibility

### 2. Model Application Analysis (`model_application_short_paper.md`)
Comparative analysis of modeling approaches:
- Process modeling with transactional workflows
- Object modeling with domain entity hierarchy
- Hybrid architecture recommendation
- Production-tested patterns from SmartAuto/OptimPrime

## Architecture Highlights

- **Dispatch Layer**: Role-based request routing
- **Cache Strategy**: Redis for hot paths, hash-diff for DMV sync
- **Audit Trail**: Event-sourced, immutable, cryptographically hashed
- **Concurrency**: Pessimistic locking with NOWAIT for conflict prevention
- **Scale**: Horizontal auto-scaling, read replicas, CDN distribution

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: Progressive Web App (SPA + Service Worker)
- Backend: Stateless API + PostgreSQL
- Cache: Redis for sessions and availability windows
- Infrastructure: Container-orchestrated, cloud-native
- Security: JWT auth, TLS 1.3, PCI-compliant tokenization

## Design Philosophy

Every operation is atomic, every state change is logged, every external dependency is wrapped. This architecture applies patterns proven in production systems handling millions of transactions.
