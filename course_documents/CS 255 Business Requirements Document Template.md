CS 255 Business Requirements Document Template

Complete this template by replacing the bracketed text with the relevant information.

This template lays out all the different sections that you need to complete for Project One. Each section has guiding questions to prompt your thinking. These questions are meant to guide your initial responses to each area. You are encouraged to go beyond these questions using what you have learned in your readings. You will need to continually reference the interview transcript as you work to make sure that you are addressing your client’s needs. There is no required length for the final document. Instead, the goal is to complete each section based on your client’s needs.

Tip: You should respond in a bulleted list for each section. This will make your thoughts easier to reference when you move into the design phase for Project Two. One starter bullet has been provided for you in each section, but you will need to add more.

System Background
What does DriverPass want the system to do? What is the problem they want to fix? What are the different components needed for this system?
[Insert text]

Objectives and Goals

Requirements
Nonfunctional Requirements
In this section, you will detail the different nonfunctional requirements for the DriverPass system. You will need to think about the different things that the system needs to function properly.

Performance Requirements
What environments (web-based, application, etc.) does this system need to run in? How fast should the system run? How often should the system be updated?
[Insert text]

Platform Constraints
What platforms (Windows, Unix, etc.) should the system run on? Does the back end require any tools, such as a database, to support this application?
[Insert text]

Accuracy and Precision
How will you distinguish between different users? Is the input case-sensitive? When should the system inform the admin of a problem?
[Insert text]

Adaptability 
Can you make changes to the user (add/remove/modify) without changing code? How will the system adapt to platform updates? What type of access does the IT admin need? 
[Insert text]

Security
What is required for the user to log in? How can you secure the connection or the data exchange between the client and the server? What should happen to the account if there is a “brute force” hacking attempt? What happens if the user forgets their password? 
[Insert text]

Functional Requirements
Using the information from the scenario, think about the different functions the system needs to provide. Each of your bullets should start with “The system shall . . .” For example, one functional requirement might be, “The system shall validate user credentials when logging in.”

User Interface
What are the needs of the interface? Who are the different users for this interface? What will each user need to be able to do through the interface? How will the user interact with the interface (mobile, browser, etc.)? 
[Insert text]

Assumptions
What things were not specifically addressed in your design above? What assumptions are you making in your design about the users or the technology they have? 
[Insert text]

Limitations
Any system you build will naturally have limitations. What limitations do you see in your system design? What limitations do you have as far as resources, time, budget, or technology?
